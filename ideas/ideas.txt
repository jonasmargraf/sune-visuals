- dumb agents with restricted path drawing svg shapes from P_2_3_1_02

- grids of smart agents that dissolve

- lfos + little bit of noise to generate paths

- check out P_2_2_4

- for dumb agent rain: instead of circles, draw various SVGs or maybe long rectangles, maybe even "binary" codes or lines that go all over screen
